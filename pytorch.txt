 This project is good enough....now i wanna try a project with pytorch....what would u suggest?

That is a fantastic pivot. While TensorFlow (Google) is great, PyTorch (Meta/Facebook) is currently the "king" of research and modern AI. Most cutting-edge papers today are released in PyTorch first.

Since you have a GTX 1650 (4GB GPU), I suggest a project that is visually impressive, runs in real-time, and is a critical skill for modern digital forensics:
Project Suggestion: "The Automated Evidence Seeker"

(Real-Time Object & Weapon Detection)

The Forensic Problem: In real investigations, you often confiscate terabytes of CCTV footage. No human can watch 500 hours of video to find the one second a suspect pulled out a knife or dropped a backpack.

The Solution: We will build a tool that scans video files at 100x speed and automatically flags frames where it sees specific "classes" of interest (e.g., a person, a backpack, a knife, a cell phone).

The Tech Stack:

    Framework: PyTorch.

    Model: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once - Version 8). It is fast enough to run on your GTX 1650 at high frame rates.

Step 1: The PyTorch Setup (Kali Linux)

PyTorch installation is slightly different than TensorFlow. We need to make sure we grab the version that speaks "CUDA" (GPU language).

1. Open a new terminal and prepare the environment:
Bash

mkdir ~/EvidenceSeeker
cd ~/EvidenceSeeker
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

2. Install PyTorch with CUDA support: Copy and paste this exact command. It tells pip to look at the official PyTorch repository for the GPU version.
Bash

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

3. Install the YOLO library (Ultralytics):
Bash

pip install ultralytics opencv-python

4. Verify your GPU is visible to PyTorch: Run this quick one-liner:
Bash

python3 -c "import torch; print(f'GPU Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()} ({torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)})')"

(If it says "True" and "GTX 1650", you are golden.)
Step 2: The Code (EvidenceSeeker.py)

This script will take a video file, scan it, and draw boxes around detected objects.

Create the file: nano evidence_seeker.py
Python

import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO
import torch
import argparse
import os

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# 'yolov8n.pt' is the "Nano" model. It is tiny and super fast.
# Perfect for the GTX 1650.
MODEL_NAME = 'yolov8n.pt' 

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Forensic Evidence Seeker (YOLOv8 + PyTorch)")
    parser.add_argument("-i", "--input", required=True, help="Path to input video file")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # 1. Check for GPU
    device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
    print(f"[*] Hardware: {device.upper()}")
    if device == 'cuda':
        print(f"[*] GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")

    # 2. Load the PyTorch Model
    print(f"[*] Loading YOLOv8 Model...")
    model = YOLO(MODEL_NAME)

    # 3. Open Video
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(args.input)
    if not cap.isOpened():
        print(f"[!] Error opening video: {args.input}")
        return

    # Get video properties for saving
    width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
    height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    
    # Create Output Saver
    save_path = "scanned_" + os.path.basename(args.input)
    # MP4V codec is widely supported
    out = cv2.VideoWriter(save_path, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'), fps, (width, height))

    print("[*] Scanning started... Press 'q' to quit early.")

    while cap.isOpened():
        success, frame = cap.read()
        if not success:
            break

        # 4. The Magic: Run Inference
        # conf=0.5 means "Only show things you are 50% sure about"
        results = model(frame, device=device, verbose=False, conf=0.5)

        # 5. Visualize
        # The 'plot()' method draws the boxes and labels on the frame
        annotated_frame = results[0].plot()

        # 6. Forensic Logging (Optional)
        # If the model sees a specific item, we could print an alert here.
        # for box in results[0].boxes:
        #     cls = int(box.cls[0])
        #     label = model.names[cls]
        #     if label in ['knife', 'gun', 'backpack', 'suitcase']:
        #          print(f"[!] ALERT: {label} detected!")

        # Show the live feed (optional, might slow it down slightly)
        cv2.imshow("Forensic Scanner", annotated_frame)
        
        # Save the frame to the new video file
        out.write(annotated_frame)

        # Quit if 'q' is pressed
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    out.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    print(f"\n[*] Scan Complete. Evidence saved to: {save_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Step 3: How to Run It

    Find a video: Download a clip of street traffic, a busy airport, or people walking. Place it in the folder.

    Run the scanner:
    Bash

    python evidence_seeker.py -i your_video.mp4

What will happen: A window will pop up showing the video in real-time. You will see colored boxes appear instantly around people, cars, bags, and ties.

    Green Box: Person

    Blue Box: Car

    Orange Box: Backpack

The scanned_video.mp4 file it saves is your "processed evidence" that you can present in a report.

Why this is a great project for you:

    It uses PyTorch: You get experience with the .pt model format.

    It's Fast: Your GTX 1650 will crush this. You should get 30-60 FPS.

    It's Extendable: Later, we can train it to detect only specific things (like "Police Uniform" or "Pistol") by creating a custom dataset.

Would you like to try this one?
